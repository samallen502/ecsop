# ðŸ‘€ Reacting to AA Summoning EC

* [ ] Once applicant has CN profile, AA summons EC by providing SID
  * [ ] If no SID, EC should ask AA to re-notify EC once SID exists (because the EC needs CN profile to analyze and a way to track the applicant for progress).
* [ ] Proceed to [Analyzing CampusNexus](analyzing-campusnexus/) section

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an AA asks you to provide on-demand FAFSA help, make sure that you vet the applicant _prior_ to engaging the applicant.  Otherwise, you will risk overserving one applicant prematurely while underserving multiple other applicants, which is unsustainable.  To qualify an applicant for FAFSA help, ask this question: "On which step of the usual FAFSA completion instructions is the applicant stuck?"



If applicant seeks FAFSA help but has not yet attempted FAFSA completion, empower the applicant with FAFSA completion instructions and await feedback from the applicant regarding the step on which the applicant got stuck.



If non-applicant seeks FAFSA help, redirect the non-applicant to 1-800-4-FED-AID.
