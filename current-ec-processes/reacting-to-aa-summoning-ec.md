# ðŸ‘€ Reacting to AA Summoning EC

* [ ] Once applicant has CN profile, AA summons EC by providing SID
  * [ ] If no SID, EC should ask AA to re-notify EC once SID exists (because the EC needs records to analyze and a way to track the student for progress).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If an AA asks you to provide on-demand FAFSA help, make sure that you vet the student _prior_ to engaging the student.  **Otherwise, you will risk overserving one student prematurely while underserving multiple other students, which is an unsustainable business practice.**  To qualify a student for FAFSA help, ask this question: "On which step of the usual FAFSA completion instructions is the student stuck?"



If applicant seeks FAFSA help but has not yet attempted FAFSA completion, empower student with FAFSA completion instructions and await feedback regarding the step on which the applicant got stuck.



If non-applicant seeks FAFSA help, redirect non-applicant to 1-800-4-FED-AID.
