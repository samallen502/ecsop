  Whenever an EC first encounters an applicant's records, an EC should perform
  an ANALYSIS of the milestones met, then identify NEXT STEPS.  Later, this will
  lend reliable clarity at a glance.

# ðŸ•µ Analyzing CampusNexus

* [ ] Review CN for VFPA setup prerequisites
  * [ ] Does CampusNexus Activities feature an ADMGenCom?
    * [ ] In CampusNexus, navigate to Contact Manager > Activities
    * [ ] Sort by "Date Completed" column
    * [ ] Scroll down to the bottom of the menu
    * [ ] Look for "ADM - General Comment" (ADMGenCom) activity
      *   [ ] ADMGenCom may be closed (preferred) or pending

          * [ ] Example:

          <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">
      * [ ] ADMGenCom may feature any content; activity just has to feature _some_ content
      * [ ] If no ADMGenCom, ask AA to add ADMGenCom and notify EC when done
  * [ ] Does EC know Q1Q2Q3?
    * [ ] Q1Q2Q3 may be featured within ADMGenCom; alternatively, AA may tell EC directly.
    * [ ] Example: 12/12/12 = 12 hours for Quarter 1, Quarter 2, & Quarter 3
  * [ ] Is Q1Q2Q3 less than or equal to maximum program length?
    * [ ] Calculate the sum of Q1Q2Q3 (for example, 12/12/12 = 36)
    *   [ ] Go [here](https://sullivanedu.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sus/admissions/Training2/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsus%2Fadmissions%2FTraining2%2F2022%20Product%20Knowledge%20Binder%20with%20Tuition%20Changes\&viewid=8cd30b7e%2Dacb6%2D4a72%2D872a%2D553b237973e4) to identify the total credit hours possible for the applicant's program of choice

        * [ ] Example:&#x20;

        ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png>)
    * [ ] If the sum of Q1Q2Q3 is less than or equal to the total credit hours for the applicant's program of choice, accept Q1Q2Q3 as valid.  Otherwise, reject Q1Q2Q3 and ask AA directly to provide a Q1Q2Q3 that is equal to or less than the total credit hours for the student's program of choice.
  * [ ] Is applicant in Future status for a particular academic start date?
    *   [ ] In CampusNexus, navigate to Admissions > Status History

        * [ ] Example:

        ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)
    * [ ] If Future, proceed.  Otherwise, monitor for Future status.
  * [ ] Per above step, is applicant enrolled in HVAC?
    *   [ ] If so,  navigate in CampusNexus to Admissions > Tests > SU-APA > Numerical

        * [ ] Example:&#x20;

        &#x20;![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

        * [ ] If APA-Numerical is greater than 265, proceed.  Otherwise, note that APA-Numerical is less than 265, which means MTH095 will be required.
    * [ ] If not, proceed.
  * [ ] Identify the financing type
    * [ ] Navigate to CampusNexus Documents ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1).png>)
    * [ ] Select the "Document" header to alphabetically sort all documents
    *   [ ] Search for and highlight "ADM - Application for Enrollment"

        * [ ] If multiples, favor the application with the most recent "Requested" date
          * [ ] If multiples, favor the application with "use for acceptance" in comments
        * [ ] Select "Display Document"
        * [ ] Select the "View Document" icon ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)
        * [ ] Look for an open one of these 2 documents:

        ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

        * [ ] Search (CTRL-F) for "plan to pay"

        ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

        * [ ] If "Financial Aid"...
          * [ ] KRD must be approved, denied, or no longer needed _unless_ ADOA declares KRD N/A for VFPA setup purposes
            * [ ] Navigate to CampusNexus Documents ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1).png>)
            * [ ] Select the "Admissions" Module: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)
            * [ ] Select the "Document" header to alphabetically sort all documents
            * [ ] Search for "ADM - Kentucky Residency Determination"
              * [ ] Ignore any review not conducted 12 months prior to the intended academic start date.
              * [ ] Focus only on the review featuring the most recent date.
              * [ ] If document is in a "requested" status, monitor document for any other status (as "requested" means KRD documents need to be submitted by applicant and reviewed by KRD Reviewer)
              * [ ] If document is in an "insufficient" status, monitor for any of these final outcomes: approved; denied; no longer needed.
                * [ ] "Approved" means applicant is eligible for _potential_ CAP/KTG grants.
                * [ ] "Denied" means applicant was disqualified from receiving CAP/KTG (reasons vary but defer to KRD Reviewer).
                * [ ] "No Longer Needed" means applicant was disqualified from receiving CAP/KTG (reasons vary but defer to KRD reviewer).
          *   [ ] 2021-22 FAFSA required for any applicant starting 7/1/2021-6/30/2022

              * [ ] Navigate to Financial Aid > ISIR

              ![](../../.gitbook/assets/isir.JPG)

              * [ ] Ensure Award Year is relevant: ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)
              * [ ] If ISIR displays and there is no C Code or Reject Code, regard ISIR as clean (error-free). Example:

              ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

              * [ ] If ISIR displays and there is a C Code but no Reject Code, check Groups for Student to see if FP logged a "date off" so that C Code may safely be disregarded. Example:

              ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

              * [ ] If ISIR displays and there is a C Code and/or Reject Code but no "date off" within Groups for Student, plan to schedule a Virtual Financial Planning Preparatory Appointment (VFPPA) for the applicant.
          * [ ] 2022-23 FAFSA required for any applicant starting 7/1/2022-6/30/2023
            * [ ] For guidance, see section directly above but change Award Year to 2022-23.
          * [ ] As of 10/1/2022, 2023-24 FAFSA required for any applicant starting 7/1/2023-6/30/2024
            * [ ] Most likely, CampusNexus will not be upgraded to show 2023-24 FAFSA until around 4/1/2023, so EC will need to secure 2023-24 FAFSA Confirmation Page Email featuring a Confirmation Number, Data Release Number, & EFC Score, then upload the email to CND
        * [ ] If "Self-Financing"...applicant will make cash payments on a monthly or quarterly basis (TBD by FPC during eventual VFPA)
        * [ ] If "VA Benefits"...
          * [ ] Campus ML to advise.
            * [ ] Louisville: Sam Allen; sallen@sullivan.edu
            * [ ] DuPont: Leah Schultz; lschultz@sullivan.edu
            * [ ] Lexington: Savannah Slusher; sslusher@sullivan.edu
            * [ ] SCO (All Campuses): Meshell LaBaun; mlabaun@sullivan.edu
        * [ ] If "Company-Paid Benefits"...
          * [ ] Navigate to CampusNexus Documents ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1).png>)
          * [ ] Select the "Financial Aid" Module: ![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)
          * [ ] Select the "Document" header to alphabetically sort all documents
          * [ ] Search for "FP - Company Pay Policy"
            * [ ] If document has been logged, highlight document, look for ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1).png>) icon to the left of highlighted document, select ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png>) button, select ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>) button, and proofread upload.
            * [ ] If no CoPayPol, ask AA to harvest CoPayPol and forward to EC when done
        * [ ] If "Military Tuition Assistance"...
          * [ ] Campus ML to advise.
            * [ ] Louisville: Sam Allen; sallen@sullivan.edu
            * [ ] DuPont: Leah Schultz; lschultz@sullivan.edu
            * [ ] Lexington: Savannah Slusher; sslusher@sullivan.edu
            * [ ] SCO (All Campuses): Meshell LaBaun; mlabaun@sullivan.edu
        * [ ] If "Yes" to "Are you currently service in the military (active duty or National Guard/Reserve)"...
          * [ ] Navigate to CampusNexus Documents ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1).png>)
          * [ ] Select the "Document" header to alphabetically sort all documents
          * [ ] Search for and highlight "ADM - Military Orders"
            * [ ] Status of "Approved" means applicant will receive a military discount
            * [ ] Status of "On File" means applicant _may_ receive a military discount _pending approval_
            * [ ] If applicant desires discount consideration, applicant may provide:
              * [ ] Leave & Earnings Statement (LES)
              * [ ] Active Duty Military Orders
              * [ ] Uniformed presence physically on-campus to AA, ML, or SCO
        * [ ] Once done with your analysis, you should log in Velocify something similar to the following:
          * [ ] ANALYSIS: ADMGenCom (6/27); 15/11/13 Q1Q2Q3; sum Q1Q2Q3 equals prog length, so OK; Fut for HVAC; APA-Num greater than 265, so MTH095 NOT required; KRD approved; clean 21-22 (IND); clean 22-23; ... NEXT: need BYOD yes/no; need conf FA/CASH (per 6/27 app); need sched VFPA -- BE SURE TO C\&P VELO GEN COM 6/30/2022 11:36a INTO EVENTUAL VFPA NOTES
