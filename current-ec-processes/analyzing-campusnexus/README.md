  Whenever an EC first encounters an applicant's records, an EC should perform
  an ANALYSIS of the milestones met, then identify NEXT STEPS.  Later, this will
  lend reliable clarity at a glance.

# ðŸ¤“ Analyzing CampusNexus

* [ ] Review CN for VFPA setup prerequisites
  * [ ] Does CampusNexus Activities feature an ADMGenCom?
    * [ ] In CampusNexus, navigate to Contact Manager > Activities
    * [ ] Sort by "Date Completed" column
    * [ ] Scroll down to the bottom of the menu
    * [ ] Look for "ADM - General Comment" (ADMGenCom) activity
      *   [ ] ADMGenCom may be closed (preferred) or pending

          * [ ] Example:

          <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" data-size="original">
      * [ ] ADMGenCom may feature any content; activity just has to feature _some_ content
      * [ ] If no ADMGenCom, ask AA to add ADMGenCom and notify EC when done
  * [ ] Does EC know Q1Q2Q3?
    * [ ] Q1Q2Q3 may be featured within ADMGenCom; alternatively, AA may tell EC directly.
    * [ ] Example: 12/12/12 = 12 hours for Quarter 1, Quarter 2, & Quarter 3
  * [ ] Is Q1Q2Q3 less than or equal to maximum program length?
    * [ ] Calculate the sum of Q1Q2Q3 (for example, 12/12/12 = 36)
    *   [ ] Go [here](https://sullivanedu.sharepoint.com.mcas.ms/sus/admissions/Training2/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsus%2Fadmissions%2FTraining2%2F2022%20Product%20Knowledge%20Binder%20with%20Tuition%20Changes\&viewid=8cd30b7e%2Dacb6%2D4a72%2D872a%2D553b237973e4) to identify the total credit hours possible for the applicant's program of choice

        * [ ] Example:&#x20;

        ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)
    * [ ] If the sum of Q1Q2Q3 is less than or equal to the total credit hours for the applicant's program of choice, accept Q1Q2Q3 as valid.  Otherwise, reject Q1Q2Q3 and ask AA directly to provide a Q1Q2Q3 that is equal to or less than the total credit hours for the student's program of choice.
  * [ ] Is applicant in Future status for a particular academic start date?
    *   [ ] In CampusNexus, navigate to Admissions > Status History

        * [ ] Example:
