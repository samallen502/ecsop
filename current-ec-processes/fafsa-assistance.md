# ðŸ†˜ FAFSA Assistance

{% hint style="warning" %}
Occasionally, an AA will ask an EC to provide an applicant with on-demand FAFSA help. Be careful not to overserve one applicant prematurely while underserving multiple other applicants. Prior to engaging the applicant, qualify the applicant for help by confirming that a CampusNexus Student ID exists and by asking the AA: "On which step of the usual FAFSA completion instructions is \[CampusNexus Student ID] stuck?"  This will ensure that the applicant applied and tried.



If the applicant seeks FAFSA help but has not yet attempted FAFSA completion, empower the applicant with FAFSA completion instructions and await feedback from the applicant regarding the step on which the applicant got stuck. You may then route this student to [SU's FAFSA Specialist](../meet-the-team/bobbie-white.md) or, if SU's FAFSA Specialist is unavailable, assist on behalf of SU's FAFSA Specialist â€” in which case before helping the EC should confirm with the applicant (and parent, if dependent) FSA ID functionality and Federal Tax Return availability (because, otherwise, the FAFSA cannot be signed digitally and there will be no failsafe should the IRS DRT fail).



If the applicant seeks FAFSA help but is dependent for financial aid filing purposes, [FSA requires](https://studentaid.gov/help/share-fsa-id) that the parent/guardian be present.



If a non-applicant seeks FAFSA help, redirect the non-applicant to 1-800-4-FED-AID.



**The only time you should deviate from the above is two weeks before and after an applicant's intended academic start date.**
