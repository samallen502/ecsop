# ðŸ‘€ Reacting to AA Pinging EC

* [ ] Once applicant has CN profile, AA summons EC by providing CN SID via email, Teams message, phone call, and/or in-person communication
  * [ ] If no CN SID, EC should ask AA to re-notify EC once SID exists (because the EC needs CN profile to analyze and a way to track the applicant for progress).
* [ ] Proceed to [Analyzing CampusNexus](analyzing-campusnexus/) section

{% hint style="warning" %}
Occasionally, an AA will ask an EC to provide an applicant with on-demand FAFSA help. Be careful not to overserve one applicant prematurely while underserving multiple other applicants. Prior to engaging the applicant, qualify the applicant for help by asking: "On which step of the usual FAFSA completion instructions is the applicant stuck?"



If the applicant seeks FAFSA help but has not yet attempted FAFSA completion, empower the applicant with FAFSA completion instructions and await feedback from the applicant regarding the step on which the applicant got stuck. You may then route this student to [SU's FAFSA Specialist](../meet-the-team/bobbie-white.md) or, if SU's FAFSA Specialist is unavailable, assist on behalf of SU's FAFSA Specialist.



If the applicant seeks FAFSA help but is dependent for financial aid filing purposes, [FSA requires](https://studentaid.gov/help/share-fsa-id) that the parent/guardian be present.



If a non-applicant seeks FAFSA help, redirect the non-applicant to 1-800-4-FED-AID.



**The only time you should deviate from the above is two weeks before and after an applicant's intended academic start date.**
