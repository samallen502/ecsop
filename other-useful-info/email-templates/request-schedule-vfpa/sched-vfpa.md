William (WMARRS1556):

Good evening!  After a careful review of your records, I have determined that as long as you will be covering your anticipated educational expenses utilizing financial aid, not employer-paid benefits or veteran benefits, a Virtual Financial Planning Appointment may be scheduled.  Congratulations!  To that effect, please share with me today the following information so that I may schedule you:

1. General windows of time you could be available (please specify if times are not for the Eastern Standard Time zone) for a 45-minute Virtual Financial Planning Appointment on the following dates: 1/6; 1/7
2. Because Virtual Financial Planning Appointments are conducted via the Microsoft Teams app, please note:
3. Once scheduled, you will be provided with a Microsoft Teams meeting link
4. You will be responsible to prepare for a successful virtual appointment by:
5. Creating or confirming your Microsoft account login credentials ([https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-us](https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-us))
6. Downloading Microsoft Teams ([https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app)) or using the web-based version ([http://teams.microsoft.com](http://teams.microsoft.com))
7. In case Financial Planning cannot make contact with you via Microsoft Teams, please provide the most reliable backup phone number and most reliable backup e-mail address for you.  Financial Planning encourages you to login to your backup e-mail account 5 minutes before the Virtual Financial Planning Appointment, just in case e-mail communication is needed.
8. Please specify whether you intend to include a laptop that would be appropriate for your academic program of choice as a financially packaged supply

Once I know more about when you are free to meet with a representative of Financial Planning, I will be happy to make arrangements, then write back to confirm what plans have been made.  I look forward to assisting you soon!  As always, thanks for choosing SU!
