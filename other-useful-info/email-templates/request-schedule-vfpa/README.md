# REQUEST: Schedule VFPA

Student (ASTUDE1234):

Good evening!  After a careful review of your records, I have determined that as long as you will be covering your anticipated educational expenses utilizing <mark style="color:purple;">financial aid</mark>, not employer-paid benefits or veteran benefits, a <mark style="color:purple;">Virtual Financial Planning Appointment</mark> may be scheduled.  Congratulations!  To that effect, please share with me today the following information so that I may schedule you:&#x20;

1. General windows of time you could be available (<mark style="color:purple;">please specify if times are not for the Eastern Standard Time zone</mark>) for a 45-minute Virtual Financial Planning Appointment on the following dates: <mark style="color:purple;">1/3; 1/4; 1/5; 1/6; & 1/7</mark>
2.  Because Virtual Financial Planning Appointments are conducted via the Microsoft Teams app, please note:

    a. Once scheduled, you will be provided with a Microsoft Teams meeting link

    b. You will be responsible to prepare for a successful virtual appointment by:

    &#x20;    i. Creating or confirming your Microsoft account login credentials ([https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-us](https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-us))

    &#x20;    ii. Downloading Microsoft Teams ([https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app)) or using the web-based version ([http://teams.microsoft.com](http://teams.microsoft.com))
3. In case Financial Planning cannot make contact with you via Microsoft Teams, please provide <mark style="color:purple;">the most reliable backup phone number and most reliable backup e-mail address for you</mark>.  Financial Planning encourages you to login to your backup e-mail account 5 minutes before the Virtual Financial Planning Appointment, just in case e-mail communication is needed.
4. Please specify <mark style="color:purple;">whether you intend to include a laptop</mark> that would be appropriate for your academic program of choice as a financially packaged supply

Once I know more about when you are free to meet with a representative of Financial Planning, I will be happy to make arrangements, then write back to confirm what plans have been made.  I look forward to assisting you soon!  As always, thanks for choosing SU!
