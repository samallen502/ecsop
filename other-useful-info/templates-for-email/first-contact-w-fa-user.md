**Subject:** Next Steps with Sullivan University

Student (STUDE1234):

Good evening!  My name is Sam and I work with your Admissions Advisor, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  One of my charges at the university is to help you progress from working exclusively within Admissions’ process to working with Financial Planning representatives regarding your financial packaging.  After a careful review of your records, I would like to advise that your next steps are as follows:

1. Seek approval for the Kentucky Residency Determination (KRD) — see attached and follow your Admissions Advisor's counsel
2. Complete the 2021-22 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) — see attached
3. Complete the 2022-23 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) — see attached

I hope I have been helpful!  As always, thanks for choosing Sullivan University!

(NOTE FOR ECs ONLY: This is a major timesaver for all involved. So many solutions to common problems have been frontloaded.  Always empower your applicants with this before you invest resources into intense, one-on-one help sessions.
