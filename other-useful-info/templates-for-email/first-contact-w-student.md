Student (STUDE1234):

Good evening!  My name is Sam and I work with your Admissions Advisor, Dean Blevins.  One of my charges at the university is to help you progress from working exclusively within Admissions’ process to working with Financial Planning representatives regarding your financial packaging.  After a careful review of your records, I would like to advise that your next steps are as follows:

1. Pursuant to gaining approval for the Kentucky Residency Determination (KRD), continue following your Admissions Advisor’s counsel.
2.  Complete the 2021-22 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)

    a. Visit [https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/dependency](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/dependency) to determine whether you are independent or dependent for financial aid filing purposes if you are unsure

    b. Visit [https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing) and confirm or create your FSA ID (parent must confirm or create an FSA ID if you are dependent for financial aid filing purposes)

    c. Using a laptop/desktop computer, visit [https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-app/ROLES](https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-app/ROLES), login using your FSA ID as the student, and begin completion of the 2021-22 FAFSA.  Alternatively, using a smartphone, visit [https://studentaid.gov/mystudentaid-mobile-app](https://studentaid.gov/mystudentaid-mobile-app), download the myStudentAid app, launch the app, expand the menu, select the “myFAFSA” option, select the “I am the student” option, login using your FSA ID, and begin completion of the 2021-22 FAFSA

    d. Within the “School Selection” section, be sure to include the school code (004619) for Sullivan University

    e. Within the “Financial Information” section, try using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) to import your 2019 Federal Tax Return digitally.  If the IRS DRT fails for you, you may add 2019 financial information to the 2021-22 FAFSA manually by using a 2019 Federal Tax Return.  Alternatively, if you cannot locate your 2019 Federal Tax Return, a 2019 Federal Tax Return Transcript may be secured online at [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript).  If none of the aforementioned strategies serve you, estimation of income information will be acceptable but you are strongly encourage to make corrections at in the future.  (Please note: the same must be done for a parent if you are dependent for financial aid filing purposes.)

    f. Forward the 2021-22 FAFSA confirmation e-mail that you receive immediately upon submitting a 2021-22 FAFSA to [sallen@sullivan.edu](mailto:sallen@sullivan.edu), making sure to identify your full name as it appeared on your Sullivan University application.
