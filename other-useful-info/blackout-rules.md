  Blackout Period" or "Crunch Time" — and there are related scheduling rules
  that you should know.

# ⚫ Blackout Rules

* [ ] If 2 weeks out from an academic start, OK to schedule 24 hours out (versus the usual 48 hours out).
  * [ ] Tip: Copy Financial Planning's SADOA, ADOA, and/or Team Lead to guard against oversights
* [ ] If SU is in a Blackout Period for a current academic start but an AA asks an EC to schedule a VFPA, EC should schedule a VFPA for 2 weeks after the current Blackout Period's academic start.
  * [ ] EXAMPLE: Imagine it's 1/9/2024 and SU just had a 1/1/2024 Start.  An AA asks you to schedule a VFPA for a 3/25/2024 Start.  Don't schedule the VFPA for any sooner than 1/16/2024 (2 weeks after the 1/1/2024 Start).
