# ‚òù Best Practices



* [ ] Identify applicant needs.  Empower the applicant according to his/her needs.  Challenge the applicant to leverage tools.
* [ ] Begin every email with "Name (SID)"
  * [ ] Benefit 1: You can quickly search your "Sent Items" folder for the applicant's unique identifier.
  * [ ] Benefit 2: The applicant will be empower with his/her Student ID, which the applicant will be asked for on the BYOD Order Form and elsewhere.
* [ ] Whenever you upload to CampusNexus, always confirm that the uploaded document is viewable.
* [ ] "Trust but verify!" When an AA tells you that an applicant is VFPA-ready, do your due diligence by executing the ANALYSIS & NEXT procedural checks.&#x20;
* [ ] Within Velocify, keep ANALYSIS & NEXT notes updated constantly so that you or the AA can quickly CTRL-F for "NEXT" at any point and determine what comes next procedurally.  These notes require an up-front time investment initially but will serve you and your teammates well afterwards.
* [ ] If applicant is 2-2.5 weeks away from academic start and applicant intends to use FA, harvest FAFSA Confirmation Page Email(s) and upload those to CND (as the emails can substitute for ISIRs).
* [ ] Always hesitate to disclose applicant information to any third parties.  Third parties must be authorized on the applicant's FERPA Form (see last page of applicant's application).
* [ ] Don't say "default" or "dependency override" but do say, "I'm going to pair you with a specialist in Financial Planning who can help you access financial aid."
* [ ] Maximize time by leveraging email to communicate lengthier and more detailed ideas (such as setting up Virtual Financial Planning Appointments) via email, then draw attention to that email later by replying, sending texts with the timestamp, leaving voicemails to check an inbox for emails from a certain name sent on a certain day, etc.
